Internet-in-a-Box Installation
==============================

While the complete dataset for the Internet-in-a-Box project is over 700 GB,
you can install the 500 MB QuickStart Sampler dataset to try the software
without needing the full dataset.

There are several methods to install and run Internet-in-a-Box (IIAB).

For installation: you can install IIAB as a Python package using the Python
package manager pip.  Or you can install from source using git.

To run: you can run IIAB as a stand-alone server, or you can integrate
it with your Apache installation using WSGI as a gateway.


Quick Start
-----------

1. Install the Python package manager, pip:

    Ubuntu/Debian:
    sudo apt-get install python-pip

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install python-pip


2. Install Internet-in-a-Box and its dependencies (on Fedora, use 'python-pip'
instead of 'pip')

    sudo pip install Internet-in-a-Box


3. Download the QuickStart Sampler dataset and untar

    mkdir iiab
    cd iiab/
    wget http://braddock.com/~braddock/iiab/IIAB_QuickStart_Sampler_20130610.tgz
    tar xvzf IIAB_QuickStart_Sampler_20130610.tgz


4. Run the stand-alone server from the directory you untarred the QuickStart sampler.
    cd iiab/
    iiab-server


5. Point your web browser to http://localhost:25000/iiab


ALTERNATIVE: Installation from Git Sources using a Virtual Environment
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recommended for developers.

1. Install pip and virtualenv

    Ubuntu/Debian:
    sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv

    Fedora:
    sudo yum install python-pip python-virtualenv


2. Clone Internet-in-a-Box from github

    git clone https://github.com/braddockcg/internet-in-a-box


3. Create virtualenv and install dependencies

    cd internet-in-a-box
    virtualenv venv
    . venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Download and untar the QuickStart Sampler dataset

    wget http://braddock.com/~braddock/iiab/IIAB_QuickStart_Sampler_20130610.tgz
    tar xvzf IIAB_QuickStart_Sampler_20130610.tgz


4. Run stand-alone server

    . venv/bin/activate
    ./iiab-server


5. Point your web browser to http://localhost:25000/iiab



Building a patched zimdump
--------------------------

We use the zimdump command line utility for our Wikipedia functionality.  We
provide binaries in the QuickStart Sampler for i686 and x86_64, but if you are
on another platform you will need to build a patched version of zimdump.  By
default IIAB will look for an executable named zimdump-patched in the
knowledge/sys/bin-`uname -m`/ directory, where `uname -m` is your machine
architecture.

Due to a bug in zimdump, we need a patched version.

    git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/p/openzim.git
    cd openzim/zimlib
    patch -p2 </knowledge/internet-in-a-box/patches/openzim.diff
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make -j4
    mkdir -p /knowledge/sys/bin-`uname -m`
    cp src/tools/zimdump /knowledge/sys/bin-`uname -m`/zimdump-patched


Dataset Location
----------------

The IIAB dataset is stored in a directory named 'knowledge'.  

By default, the IIAB software searches for its dataset 'knowledge' directory in
the root filesystem, and then in the root of every mounted disk.  It then
checks for 'knowledge' in the current working directory.  

So if you have placed the dataset in a directory named 'knowledge' on an
external USB drive, IIAB should find it by default.

You can specify another location by setting 'knowledge_dir' in the 'DEFAULT'
section of the configuration file.  For example:

cat <<EOF >/etc/iiab.conf
[DEFAULT]
knowledge_dir = /mnt/data/knowledge
search_for_knowledge_dir = False
EOF


Configuration Files
-------------------

Upon startup, IIAB reads the following configuration files in order if they
exist:

    (install dir)/iiab/defaults.ini
    (install dir)/iiab/wsgi.ini (Only if run as a WSGI script)
    /etc/iiab.conf
    $(HOME)/.iiab.conf
    Any file specified with command line --config option

Directives in later files can override earlier directives.  See
iiab/defaults.ini for available options.
