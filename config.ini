;; You should NOT edit this file if you are only
;; making changes for your local machine.  
;;
;; Instead create a local.ini file which will automatically
;; be loaded AFTER this file loads, and can be used to 
;; override any settings in this file.  Do NOT check your local.ini
;; into the repository, it is for your personal use only.
;;
;; Variable "interpolation" can be used to incorporate
;; values from previous assignments within a setting value.
;;
;; For example,
;; b = BAAAH
;; a = a%(b)sc
;;
;; will result in the value of 'a' being 'aBAAHc'.  Note the 's'
;; following the parenthesis is NECESSARY (to denote a string?)
;;
;; [DEFAULT] is a special section.  Any settings there
;; will automatically appear in all other sections.
